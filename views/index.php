    <a href="samurai_js/payment_form.php"><img src="images/katana-sword.jpg" width="190" height="190"></a>
    <p>
      This razor-sharp sword will cut through all of your API integration headaches.
      It provides AJAX-powered payments with simple, drop-in forms that you can customize
      with ease. PCI compliance is a cinch, because the credit card data never touches your server.

    <h2><a href="transparent_redirect/payment_form.php">Transparent Redirect Nunchucks</a></h2>
    <a href="transparent_redirect/payment_form.php"><img src="images/nunchucks.jpg" width="190" height="190"></a>
    <p>
      These nunchunks come bundled with our Transparent Redirect process, a simple pure-HTML method for
      processing payments without letting the credit cards touch your server.
      You point the payment form at Samurai's secure servers, and we send back a token that you can
      use to process transactions. Simple, effective, <em>deadly</em>.

    <h2><a href="server_to_server/payment_form.php">Server-to-Server Battle Axe</a></h2>
    <a href="server_to_server/payment_form.php"><img src="images/battle-axe.jpg" width="190" height="190"></a>
    <p>
      Sometimes you just need to hack your way through. For these situations, our server-to-server
      battle axe API is precisely the right tool for the job. Simply POST the credit card details to your
      server, and process the transaction on the backend.
      <em>(Note: those pesky PCI-compliance ninjas are sure to harass you with this approach, but you can handle it.)</em>
